## üìñ Overview

This project is a powerful and user-friendly tool for conducting comprehensive econometric analysis. Built entirely in Python with the Streamlit framework, the dashboard allows users to upload their own datasets (CSV or Excel) and interactively explore relationships between variables.

Its standout feature is the dual-analysis capability for multiple regression, allowing users to seamlessly switch between analyzing raw price levels and automatically calculated logarithmic returns. The application streamlines the workflow by presenting a full suite of analyses‚Äîfrom exploratory data visualizations to detailed regression diagnostics‚Äîin a clean, tabbed interface, empowering users to derive deep insights without writing any code.

## ‚ú® Features

- **‚úåÔ∏è Dual Regression Modes:** Choose between **Simple** and **Multiple** Linear Regression.
- **üîÄ Prices vs. Returns Analysis:** Seamlessly switch between analyzing raw price levels or auto-calculated log returns for multiple regression.
- **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Flexible Data Upload:** Supports both CSV and Excel file formats.
- **üî¢ Automatic Equation Generation::** Displays both the general mathematical formula and the final fitted regression equation with calculated coefficients.
- **üìâ OLS Regression:** Instantly run an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model on the selected variables.
- **üìÑ Detailed Summaries:** View a complete OLS regression results table, including coefficients, R-squared, p-values, and other key statistics.
- **üîç Data Preview:** Inspect the first few rows of your uploaded data to ensure it's loaded correctly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Streamlit:** For building and deploying the interactive web application.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy:** For high-performance numerical operations, including log return calculations.
